Program: Program1.sas
Data: mydata.txt
Objective: The program reads demographic information (Gender, age, height, and weight) from the above data file
and then calculates/displays mean & standard deviations, CANDISC Proc (canonical discriminant analysis),
as well as the respective graphic(s).
The categorical/classification variable is gender. The the quantitative variables are age, weight, and height.
The CANDISC Procedure will be used for the analysis. The number of canonical variables will equal the # of original
variables or the # of classes minus one, whichever is smaller.
The code below can be ran in your SAS software. You'll need to use the upload function and Import Data options to 
import the external data set.
Note: The RUN statement is not required between steps, using it will create a step boundary and makes the SAS log 
easier to read. Also, if a data step is not to be ran, use the RUN with CANCEL option to end the DATA step and pevent 
it from executing.
